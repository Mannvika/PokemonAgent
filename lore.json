It can be reached in three ways: via an elevator in the Pyrite Bldg , The Under Subway , or a mine shaft not too far from the west of Pyrite. The Under is home to two Colosseums: Under Colosseum and Deep Colosseum . The city is mostly pro- Cipher apart from a few citizens, most notably the anti-Cipher Kids Grid network. It only appears in Pok\u00e9mon Colosseum . It is connected to the Shadow PKMN Lab by The Under Subway. A chasm in the northern part of Pyrite Town allows sunlight to reach parts of The Under. This same chasm also separates The Under into two halves: the northern half, which is home to both Colosseums, and the southern half, the home of most of the city's commercial establishments. A UFO operated by Disks connects the two halves. It was originally an artificial town constructed for the convenience of the miners of Pyrite. Instead of having to commute between Pyrite and the mine each day, the workers assigned to dig in the mine would stay in The Under instead. When the mine closed, the miners chose to remain in their adopted home. Now, most of The Under is populated by the descendants of the original mining crew. The original inhabitants that still live in The Under are quite old, but are fond of telling stories of when the mine was in its prime. Since The Under is a full-fledged city in itself, many of its inhabitants have rarely, and in some cases never have, been to the surface. It is for this reason that the residents tend to be suspicious of those visiting from Pyrite. A fenced-off area in the southeastern portion of The Under serves as the town's makeshift prison; it is in this structure that visitors from the surface are occasionally detained. In Pok\u00e9mon XD: Gale of Darkness , The Under is completely inaccessible because it had been buried due to the incident with Cipher, as villains like Lady Venus could use The Under to hide out. The former residents have since moved to new homes in Pyrite Town and Gateon Port ."},

Pyrite was an honorable town of thugs and scoundrels where Shadow Pok\u00e9mon were once distributed before the player and Rui put a stop to it in Pok\u00e9mon Colosseum . Once a mining town, most of the residents have resorted to a life of crime since the town's livelihood began to wane.

Pyrite is known locally as \"the town of earth, wind, and money\". A large chasm separates Pyrite Colosseum from the rest of the town; however, a bridge over the chasm provides access between the two areas. The chasm extends as deep as The Under , a subterranean city situated directly beneath Pyrite. Originally, The Under and Pyrite Town were twin cities of a mining community. However, traffic between The Under and Pyrite Town slowed to a trickle once the mine was closed.
